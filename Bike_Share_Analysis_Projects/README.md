# Google-Data-Analytics_Case-Study-1

I started my Google Data Analysis course in November 2022, and I learned SQl, R, and other related knowledge systematically during these three months. This project is called "How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?", which is the final design project of Google Data Analysis course, and I hope to use it as a springboard to start a new career journey.

## Scenario

I'm a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 

Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. My team will design a new marketing strategy from these insights to convert casual riders into annual members. But ﬁrst, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Characters and teams

- **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also oﬀering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

- **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

- **Cyclistic marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. I joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals.

- **Cyclistic executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
