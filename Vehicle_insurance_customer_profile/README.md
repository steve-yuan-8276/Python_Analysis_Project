# Vehicle Insurance Customer Profile Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vehicle insurance data to identify patterns and relationships between customer profiles and their insurance claims. The analysis is performed using Python, with visualizations created to explore the relationships between variables such as marital status, age, experience, and gender with insurance claim history.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, categorizing variables, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations to understand distributions and relationships, including box plots, count plots, and stacked bar plots.
- **Insights**: Findings on how demographic factors like gender and marital status relate to the likelihood of filing a claim.

## Visualizations

- **Box Plots**: Used to compare distributions of age and experience across different loss flags.
- **Count & Proportion Plots**: Demonstrate the absolute and relative frequencies of insurance claims across different customer segments.
