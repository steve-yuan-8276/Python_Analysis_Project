# Exam Results Prediction (Logistic Regression)

This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression to predict exam results based on historical data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can create a model that accurately forecasts whether students will pass or fail their exams.

## Project Overview

Using the data from `exam_data.csv`, this project involves building a logistic regression model to predict exam outcomes. Additionally, it explores the use of second-order model boundaries to enhance the prediction accuracy of the logistic regression model.

## Tasks

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load and clean the dataset from `exam_data.csv`.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and key features.

2. **Logistic Regression Model:**
   - Develop a logistic regression model to predict exam results.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

3. **Second-Order Model Boundaries:**
   - Establish and integrate second-order model boundaries to improve prediction accuracy.
   - Compare the performance of the enhanced model with the initial logistic regression model.

## Solution

The complete analysis, including data preparation, model development, and performance evaluation, is provided in the Jupyter Notebook [Exam_results_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/steve-yuan-8276/machine_learning/blob/main/Exam_Results_Prediction(Logistic%20Regression)/Exam_results_prediction.ipynb).

## Skills Utilized

- **Machine Learning:** Applied logistic regression to predict binary outcomes.
- **Python:** Utilized Python for data processing, model development, and visualization.
- **Logistic Regression:** Implemented and fine-tuned a logistic regression model.
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted thorough data analysis to extract meaningful insights and improve model accuracy.
