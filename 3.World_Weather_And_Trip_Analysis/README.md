# World Weather and Trip Analysis

## Overview

The World Weather and Trip Analysis project uses Python libraries, API calls, and data visualization techniques to explore how weather varies with latitude and to assist in planning travel based on weather preferences. The project consists of two main components: **WeatherPy** and **VacationPy**, detailed in separate Jupyter Notebooks.

### APIs Used

- **OpenWeatherMap**: For accessing real-time weather data.
- **Geoapify**: For mapping and geographic information.

## WeatherPy

This notebook delves into the relationship between latitude and various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, offering insights into how weather changes relative to the equator.

### Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathers weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for various global cities.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates scatter plots to examine the relationship between latitude and weather variables.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Uses linear regression to analyze weather patterns in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

## VacationPy

VacationPy utilizes the weather data to identify potential vacation destinations that meet specific weather criteria and locates hotels in these areas.

### Key Features

- **Ideal Weather Filter**: Filters cities based on user-defined criteria such as ideal temperature, wind speed, and cloudiness.
- **Hotel Search**: Finds hotels in the vicinity of the selected cities using the Google Places API.
- **Mapping**: Visualizes the locations of selected cities and hotels on interactive maps.

## Python Libraries and Analytical Methods

### Libraries Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For creating visualizations.
- `requests`: For making API requests.
- `scipy`: For conducting statistical tests.
- `gmaps`: For generating interactive maps.
- `ipywidgets`: For creating interactive Jupyter Notebook widgets.

### Analytical Techniques

- **Statistical Analysis**: Linear regression models to understand relationships between geographic location and weather parameters.
- **Data Visualization**: Techniques including scatter plots, box charts, and geographical mappings to display data and analysis results.
- **API Interaction**: Methodical data fetching and handling from weather and geographical APIs.

## Conclusion

The analysis provided in this project offers valuable insights into geographic and temporal variations in weather, aiding travelers in making informed decisions based on preferred weather conditions. The project also serves as a useful tool for environmental scientists and policymakers to visualize and understand complex meteorological data for better planning and decision-making.
